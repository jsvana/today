# today

`today` is a small utility to keep track of what you're doing and what you need to do. Similar to a todo app, but much less well-defined.

## Usage

    $ python setup.py install
    $ today

## Motivation

I'm very lazy and disorganized. This project allows me to simply run `today` at the beginning of every day while loosely keeping track of things I've done in the past.
